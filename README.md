# Hey there! I'm William Martin 👋🏻😁

## About Me

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. I have a concentration in Cybersecurity, and a minor in business! I have been programming since I was 11-years-old, with my first programming language being Lua! I have been involved in business operations since 19, when [my best friend](https://github.com/tmbailey0304) and I opened our first website together.
