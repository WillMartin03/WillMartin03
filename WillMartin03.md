# Hi there, my name is William Martin 👋🏻😁!

## About Me

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and have a concentration in Cybersecurity. I also have a minor in business, and have been programming since I was 11-years-old. I have been involved in the business realm since 19, when [my best friend](https://github.com/tmbailey0304) and I opened our first website together.
